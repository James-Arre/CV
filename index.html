  <h2>Favorite Life Lessons</h2>
  <p><strong>"Pursue What‚Äôs Meaningful"</strong> <br>Seeking things that give us immediate pleasure tends to strip us of purposeful life in the long run. On the contrary, not giving in to temptations adds meaning to life and makes us happier.
    To find meaning in life, we need to pay attention to the world and its sufferings. Pondering it will lead us to find solutions to make a better future for ourselves and others. Further, meaning comes by doing something each day to change the
    world for the better.
  </p>
  <p> <strong>‚ÄúAbandon ideology‚Äù </strong> <br>Is a nugget of wisdom from Peterson‚Äôs new book. He says that all ideas should be respected but recommends staying away from strictly following ideologies.
    Blind following often leads us to an imaginary world where we start treating people on the other side as enemies.
    So, instead of accepting or rejecting an idea, it is better to respect them and develop humility. Moreover, we should commit ourselves to important things in life that will lead us to inner fulfillment.</p>
  <p> <strong> "Risks Make You Resilient" </strong><br>
    ‚ÄúLeave children alone when they are skateboarding‚Äù is a rather interesting rule for life given by Peterson. Through this rule, he throws light on the human tendency to enjoy some element of danger and learn from it.
    We have been living in unprecedented comfort compared to our ancestors, which is making us weak. The whole idea of this rule is to let our children (as well as ourselves) get exposed to some risks. This helps to build resilience.</p>
